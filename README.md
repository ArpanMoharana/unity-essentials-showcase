# 🚀 Unity Essentials Showcase 🚀

Welcome to my final project for the **Unity Essentials Pathway**! This repository contains the source code for a collection of scenes and mini-games I built while mastering the fundamentals of the Unity Engine. It showcases the core skills learned throughout the official Unity Learn curriculum, from basic scene setup to C# scripting and publishing.
